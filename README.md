I chose this question because I enjoy chatting with strangers in random places, such as planes. However, I have always been curious on how many people simply find my chattiness unnecessary and even, rude. This was interesting as my chart reveals that in fact a lot of people do not find this rude at all, and has given me the confidence and peace of mind to continue chatting away.

This is the chart below.
